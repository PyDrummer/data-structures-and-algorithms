# Trees_intersection

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.
Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Recalled my implementation of binary tree and the class methods such as in_order. Then I built out a quick comparison. Added extra functionality to handle dupes inside the binary tree.

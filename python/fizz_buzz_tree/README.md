## Code Challenge: Class 18

## Challenge:
Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a k-ary tree while traversing through it to create a new tree.

Set the values of each of the new nodes depending on the corresponding node value in the source tree.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I started with trying this on my own and spent about 5 + hours failing lol. Next i reached out to TAs and co-students.
I got help from Alex!

## Code Challenge: Class 35: Graph 

## Challenge:
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list and have these:
- AddNode()
- AddEdge()
- GetNodes()
- GetNeighbors()
- Size()

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I utilized what I have learned from previous code challenges and understanding of data structures to figure out the solutions. 0 googling this time.

## Code Challenge: Class 36: Breadth First 

## Challenge:
Implement a breadth-first traversal on a graph.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
First tried using a queue, my queue implementation wasnt working correctly so i switched to using lists.

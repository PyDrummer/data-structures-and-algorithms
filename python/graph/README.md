## Code Challenge: Class 35: Graph 

## Challenge:
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list and have these:
- AddNode()
- AddEdge()
- GetNodes()
- GetNeighbors()
- Size()

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I utilized what I have learned from previous code challenges and understanding of data structures to figure out the solutions. 0 googling this time.

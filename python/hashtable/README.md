<!-- Challenge 05 -->
# Hashtable
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:

- add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
- get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
- contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
- hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
To get all tests to pass and classes to work correctly.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I followed along with Roger's demo then had to figure it out from there. Used a bit of googling but more of my own testing this time.

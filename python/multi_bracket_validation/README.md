## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
To get all tests to pass and classes to work correctly.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Started googling examples then decided to create my own. By storing the index of either the front or back lists i can compare if these are the same. So when i get the (] my script will know that ( has an index stored of 0, while ] has an index of 2. These aren't equal so it will be False.

# Array Binary Search
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in a sorted array and a key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index at which our key is found in the array.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
To find the index in this sorted array.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
First searched the web for different ways to handle this (iteratively and recursively). Unfortunately i couldnt find a recursive method without taking in 4 seperate variables.

## Solution
